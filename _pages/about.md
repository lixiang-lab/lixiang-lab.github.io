I am a third-year direct Ph.D. student at the School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, advised by [Prof. Yun Li](https://www.yunligroup.org/) and [Prof. Qiong Chang](https://changqiong.github.io/). I received my Bachelor's degree from Nanchang University, China.

My research focuses on GPU-based parallel computing for accelerating key algorithms in computer vision (particularly image processing), graph algorithms, and large-scale data processing.
